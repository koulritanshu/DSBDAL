In the field of astronomy, telescopes serve as our windows to the cosmos, capturing photons emitted by celestial bodies millions of light-years away. Through these lenses, we observe the intricate dance of galaxies, each containing billions of stars held together by gravity's unyielding embrace. Amidst these stellar congregations, nebulae shimmer with the birth of new stars, their gaseous clouds sculpted by the forces of radiation and stellar winds. Closer to home, our own solar system teems with activity, with planets orbiting the Sun in a delicate balance of gravitational forces. Yet, beyond the familiar realms of our own cosmic backyard, lie the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy, invisible forces that shape the very fabric of the universe, yet elude our understanding.
